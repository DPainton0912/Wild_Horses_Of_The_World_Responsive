                The wild horse (Equus caballus) is a species of the genus Equus,
                which includes as subspecies the modern domesticated horse
                (Equus caballus caballus) as well as the endangered
                Przewalski's horse (Equus caballus przewalskii).
                The European wild horse, also known as the tarpan,
                that went extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century has
                previously been classified as a subspecies of wild horse
                (Equus caballus ferus), but more recent studies have cast
                doubt on whether those horses were truly wild or if they
                actually were feral horses or hybrids. Przewalski's horse
                had reached the brink of extinction, but was reintroduced
                successfully into the wild. he tarpan became extinct in the
                19th century, but is theorized to have been present on the
                steppes of Eurasia at the time of domestication.
                However, other subspecies of Equus caballus may have existed
                and could have been the stock from which domesticated horses
                are descended. Since the extinction of the tarpan,
                attempts have been made to reconstruct its phenotype
                using domestic horses, resulting in horse breeds such as the
                Heck horse. However, the genetic makeup and foundation
                bloodstock of those breeds is substantially derived from
                domesticated horses, so these breeds possess domesticated
                traits. The term "wild horse" is also used colloquially in
                reference to free-roaming herds of feral horses; for example,
                the mustang in the United States, and the brumby in Australia.
                These feral horses are untamed members of the domestic horse
                subspecies (Equus caballus caballus), not to be confused with
                the truly "wild" horse subspecies extant into modern times.

            <h3>Distribution</h3>
            <p>
                Evidence supports E. caballus as having evolved in North America
                about 1.1 - 1.2 million years ago. Around 800,000 - 900,000 years
                ago, E. caballus migrated west to Eurasia via the Bering Land Bridge,
                and south to South America via the Isthmus of Panama as part of the
                Great American Interchange. By the mid-late Pleistocene, it had an extremely
                large range across the Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa, across which
                it was abundant. There have been several fossil horse taxa from throughout
                this range, such as Equus lambei and Amerhippus, that were formerly considered
                distinct species, but genetic and morphological analysis supports them as being
                conspecific with E. caballus. By the latest Pleistocene or early Holocene,
                American populations had disappeared as part of the Quaternary extinction event,
                leaving only the Old World populations. It remained widespread there and was
                ultimately also domesticated around 3600 B.C., but wild populations continued
                to decline. The last completely wild populations of the tarpan went extinct in
                Eastern Europe and the southern parts of Russia around the late 19th century,
                and Przewalski's horse of Central Asia became extinct in the wild in 1969.
                However, over the past few centuries feral horses have been introduced to all
                continents except Antarctica, and Przewalski's horses have been reintroduced
                to their former habitats in Mongolia.

                <h3>Ecology</h3>
                <p>
                    In general, wild horses are grazers that prefer to inhabit open areas,
                    such as steppes and grasslands. They may have seasonal food preferences,
                    as seen in the Przewalski's subspecies. Horses may fall prey to native
                    predators where they live, such as wolves, cougars and spotted hyenas.

            <h3>Subspecies and their history</h3>
                    <p>
                        E. caballus has had several subspecies, only three of which have
                        survived into modern times:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The domestic horse (Equus caballus caballus).</li>

                            <li>
                                The Eurasian wild horse (Equus caballus ferus);
                                originally considered synonymous with the tarpan,
                                though recent research has cast doubt on this.
                                The tarpan was once native to Europe and
                                western Asia before it became effectively extinct
                                in the late 19th century. The last specimen died
                                in 1909 whilst in captivity in an estate in
                                Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Przewalski's horse (Equus caballus przewalskii);
                                also known as the Mongolian wild horse or takhi,
                                it is native to Central Asia and the Gobi Desert.
                                It is sometimes considered its own species,
                                (Equus przewalskii).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The latter two are the only never-domesticated "wild"
                        groups that survived into historic times. However,
                        other subspecies of Equus caballus may have existed.
                        In the Late Pleistocene epoch, there were several
                        other subspecies of E.caballus which have all since
                        gone extinct. The exact categorization of Equus'
                        remains into species or subspecies is a complex
                        matter and the subject of ongoing work.

            <h3>Evolutionary history and taxonomy</h3>
            <p>
                The horse family Equidae and the genus Equus evolved in
                North America during the Pliocene, before the species
                migrated across Beringia into the Eastern Hemisphere.
                Studies using ancient DNA, as well as DNA of recent
                individuals, suggest the presence of two equine species
                in Late Pleistocene North America, a caballine species,
                suggested to be conspecific with the wild horse,
                and Haringtonhippus francisci, the
                "New World stilt-legged horse"; the latter has been
                taxonomically assigned to various names, and appears to
                be outside the grouping containing all extant equines.
                In South America there appear to have been severalspecies
                of equine, Equus (Amerhippus) neogeus, which had previously
                thought to represent 5 taxa due to morphological variability,
                 and several species of Hippidion, which also lie outside
                 the group containing all living horses. (It had previously
                 been suggested to have been nested within Equus based on
                 incomplete sequence data) Currently, three subspecies that
                 lived during recorded human history are recognized.
                 One subspecies is the widespread domestic horse
                 (Equus caballus caballus), as well as two wild subspecies:
                 the recently extinct European wild horse (E. c. ferus) and
                 the endangered Przewalski's horse (E. c. przewalskii).
                 Genetically, the pre-domestication horse, E. c. ferus,
                 and the domesticated horse, E. c. caballus, form a single
                 homogeneous group (clade) and are genetically
                 indistinguishable from each other.
